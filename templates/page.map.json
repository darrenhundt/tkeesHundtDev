We take a great deal of time and effort to design and manufacture our products, and wish to protect against price-based advertising that harms our ability to maintain a high level of support and service to our consumers. To protect our brand and our premium image, which is the basis of our hard-won and well-earned reputation with our consumers, we are unilaterally announcing this Minimum Advertised Policy (“MAP Policy”). Our goal is to ensure that the advertising practices of TKEES Sellers and Resellers support our brand, best serve our consumers, and allow for the continued investment in, and competitive position of, our products.<\/p><p>This MAP Policy applies to our distributors, wholesalers, and retailers (referred to as “Sellers”) and any resellers of TKEES products whether authorized or not (collectively referred to in this Policy as “Resellers”) so that their advertising practices protect and do not undermine the integrity and competitive position of our brands. This MAP Policy covers all of the items listed in the attached Schedule. TKEES is solely and unilaterally responsible for establishing the minimum advertised price (“MAP”) for each item listed in the Schedule. The MAP for each listed item will be communicated to our Sellers and Resellers by TKEES.<br\/><br\/>This Policy is exclusively concerned with minimum advertised prices; Sellers and Resellers are and will remain free to establish their own selling prices.
